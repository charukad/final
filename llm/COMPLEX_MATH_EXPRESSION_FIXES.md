# Complex Mathematical Expression Handling Fixes

## Problem

The visualization system was failing to correctly handle various complex mathematical expressions, especially:

1. Expressions with negative exponents like `(x^2+y^2)^-2`
2. Fractions and division operations like `1/(x^2+y^2)`
3. Expressions with unbalanced parentheses
4. Special mathematical functions (trigonometric, logarithmic, etc.)
5. **NEW:** Implicit equations like `z^2-x^2-y^2=-1` where z isn't explicitly isolated

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced JSON String Cleaning (`nlp_visualization.py`)

- Improved regex patterns for power notation conversion, especially for negative exponents
- Added special handling for complex fractions in 3D functions
- Implemented parenthesis balancing for expressions
- Added support for various mathematical functions (trigonometric, logarithmic, etc.)
- Added preprocessing for specialized expressions (e.g., square roots, complex nested functions)
- **NEW:** Added detection for implicit equations like hyperboloids (`z^2-x^2-y^2=-1`)

### 2. Improved 3D Plotting (`plot_3d.py`)

- Added a dedicated `preprocess_expression()` function to handle common issues:
  - Removing prefixes like "z=" or "f(x,y)="
  - Converting caret notation to power notation
  - Handling negative exponents
  - Adding numpy prefixes to mathematical functions
  - Ensuring balanced parentheses
- Enhanced error handling and recovery:
  - More robust expression parsing with fallbacks
  - Domain error handling with safe evaluation
  - Automatic domain adjustment for functions with singularities
  - Better error messages for specific types of failures

### 3. Enhanced Message Processing (`super_viz_agent.py`)

- Improved preprocessing for different visualization types
- Added specialized handling for:
  - Negative exponents in 3D functions
  - Complex fractions with proper division
  - Special mathematical functions with numpy prefixes
  - Parenthesis balancing
- **NEW:** Added detection and reformulation of implicit equations:
  - Identifies equations where z appears with powers (z^2)
  - Reformulates equations like `z^2-x^2-y^2=-1` to solve for z
  - Handles both positive and negative parts of surfaces like hyperboloids

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created to verify the fixes:

1. `test_complex_expressions.py`: Tests various complex expressions
2. `test_3d_expressions.sh`: Script to run the tests and verify results
3. **NEW:** `test_implicit_equations.py`: Tests implicit equations like hyperboloids and quadric surfaces
4. **NEW:** `test_implicit_equations.sh`: Script to run the implicit equation tests

The test suite includes cases for:
- Basic expressions
- Negative exponents
- Fractions and division
- Expressions with prefixes
- Trigonometric functions
- Special surfaces (e.g., hemisphere, circle cap)
- Complex combined expressions
- Expressions with syntax issues that should be automatically fixed
- **NEW:** Implicit equations (hyperboloids, ellipsoids, cones, etc.)

## Usage

To test the fixes:

```bash
cd llm
./test_3d_expressions.sh    # Test general complex expressions
./test_implicit_equations.sh # Test implicit equations like z^2-x^2-y^2=-1
```

This will generate visualizations for all test cases and provide a summary of successful and failed tests.

## Supported Mathematical Expressions

The system now supports a wide range of mathematical expressions, including:

1. Basic algebraic expressions: `x^2 + y^2`, `x^3 - 3xy^2`
2. Expressions with negative exponents: `(x^2+y^2)^-2`
3. Fractions: `1/(x^2+y^2+1)`, `x^2/(1+y^2)`
4. Trigonometric functions: `sin(x)*cos(y)`, `tan(xy)`
5. Logarithmic and exponential: `e^-(x^2+y^2)`, `ln(x^2+y^2+1)`
6. Square roots and complex functions: `sin(sqrt(x^2+y^2))`, `arctan(y/x)`
7. Famous surfaces: `sqrt(9-x^2-y^2)` (hemisphere), `x^2-y^2` (saddle)
8. **NEW:** Implicit quadric surfaces:
   - Hyperboloid of one sheet: `x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1` 
   - Hyperboloid of two sheets: `z^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 1`
   - Ellipsoid: `x^2/4 + y^2/9 + z^2/16 = 1`
   - Cone: `z^2 = x^2 + y^2`
   - Sphere: `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9`
